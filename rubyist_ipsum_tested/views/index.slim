    p#description This is a twist on a lorem ipsum generator - for things Rubyists say.

    p Give me at least this many words:

    form action='/'
      input name='words' type='number' value=params[:words]
      input#words_submit type='submit'

    p#generated_ipsum
      = ipsum_with_count params[:words]
